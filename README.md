<li>Open the `Wijnderlust` file.</li>
<li>Double-click the `Wijnderlust.xcworkspace` file. Ensure it is the **.xcworkspace** and *not* the **.xcodeproj** file. This should open Xcode. Otherwise, open Xcode, and then `File > Open` the **.xcworkspace**.</li>
<li>This will open the project in Xcode. In the top left of the window there is a Play and Stop button followed by an element which says `Wijnderlust > [An iOS Device]`. </li>

<li>Press Play. This may take a little while as it is the first running of the application. Xcode will build and package the app to the simulated iPhone 8. There will be a progress bar in the centre, you do not need to do anything. You *may* be prompted to 'Install additional components' by Xcode. **Do this** and the app should continue to run, and open in the Simulator</li> 
<li>When complete, you should see an iPhone on your screen with the app running.</li>
</ul>
